		<!-- This determines at what proportion of an attacker's melee range they
			should stop trying to move toward their target. The primary purpose of this
			is to stop attackers from trying to move directly onto the target's
			position regardless of their target's presence. When they do this, they
			typically "push" their target and also appear to be constantly running
			into the target despite being in range.
	
			By using a proportion of their melee range as a distance at which the
			attacker should stop moving, the attacker will simply stop when in range,
			which looks much better and prevents pushing. -->

		<!-- This determines how much of a target's movement (per tick) is added
			to the destination of an entity's path. For example, if the target is
			moving directly away from the attacking entity, the attacking entity will
			actually be trying to move slightly in front of their target (although
			still respecting the Stop Range), making it more likely for them to be in
			range for a melee attack. -->
