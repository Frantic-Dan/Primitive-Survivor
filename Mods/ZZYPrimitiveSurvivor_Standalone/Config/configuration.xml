Key features:

- Reworked skill tree, similar to how it was in A17.
- Some perks have been removed, while new ones have been added.

- You're less likely to get infected, infection treatment items give an infection immunity buff, however, once you get infected, it's permanent.

- This mod turns 7 Days to Die back into a survival game again, early game you'll struggle with food and water.
